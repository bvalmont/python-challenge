  * The total number of months included in the dataset
  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
